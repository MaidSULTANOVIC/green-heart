# Green Heart

Eating healthy and green is easier than you think!

## Description

This project was done for SPRM course at VIA University during an Erasmus exchange.  

The aim of the project was to develop an application that helped the user commit to a healthy lifestyle, mostly in terms of food and body shape, with recipes and the number of calories consumed and burned. We wanted the app to follow the evolution of the userâ€™s meals and weight.

## Presentation

You can find a link to a video presentation of the app [here (youtube link)](https://youtu.be/JXlXKqSU5RY).

## Building

In order to build the app in local, you need to create your own account for [Google API](https://console.developers.google.com/) and register your app in it and enabling Fitness API. Then, you need to generate an [API key for recipe](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) and put it in the project. 

Because the app is not released, in order to access the app (even if you have the .apk) you need specific role and your email adress needs to be whitelisted.

Then, you need to `flutter pubg get` and `flutter run`
